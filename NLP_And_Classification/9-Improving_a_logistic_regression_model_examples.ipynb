The logistic regression model contains a hyperparameter _C_, which is used to control the penalty we apply to features that are less important (i.e. more important features will have greater weight).\n",

You will recall from regression the regularisation methods Ridge and LASSO, which sought to minimise the L2- or L1-norm, respectively, by shrinking the coefficients of certain features. The penalty term had a coefficient of its own, which we called $\\alpha$, which controlled the severity of shrinkage that occurred. The _C_ value we will change here is precisely the _inverse_ value of $\\alpha$. In other words, the smaller the value of C, the greater the shrinkage that occurs."
