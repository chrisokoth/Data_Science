This repository contains various data science projects and exercises that I have worked on. The projects cover a range of topics such as data cleaning, data exploration, visualization, machine learning, and deep learning. Each project includes a Jupyter notebook or Python script with detailed explanations and code. These projects are intended to showcase my skills and experience in data science and can be used as a reference for others interested in learning about data science techniques and methodologies.
